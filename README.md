# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V.Isualize assigned us an assignment asking us to make:
- A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type.
- A multiple-line chart, with on eline for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week

## Resources
- Data Source:
    - city_data.csv
    - ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.8.2

## Delivering Results
The purpose of this assignment was to practice using matplotlib to visualize data and pandas to create series and dataframes in Jupyter Notebook.
